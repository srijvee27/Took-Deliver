          <p>
            If a merchant cancels a prepaid order prior to rider pickup, the full delivery charge is instantly refunded to
            the merchant’s balance or reversed to the original bKash payment source within 3-5 business days.

          <p>
            If a consignment is returned after standard delivery attempts have been exhausted, a return charge equal to 50%
            of the forward delivery charge is levied to cover reverse transit and restocking to the merchant warehouse.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900">3. Lost or Damaged Parcel Compensation</h2>
